So, \nhow exactly should you go about securing your digital assets in 2021?\nBy securing your private keys, deposit addresses, and credentials, you can \nmitigate cyberattacks from both inside and outside the organization. \nUntil now, this meant utilizing technologies like multisig, or HSMs. Many custody \nproviders relied on one of these technologies in isolation (or even a newer \ntechnology, like first-gen MPC) to safeguard assets.\nHowever, in today\u2019s market, these technologies are not sufficient enough to both \nwithstand attacks and support evolving business operations. In order to turn a \nprofit with digital assets, operational flexibility and efficiency are of the utmost \nimportance. Last-gen tech is simply too slow and cumbersome to support today\u2019s \nrapidly changing market \u2013 and when it\u2019s used in isolation, it\u2019s also far too weak to \nprotect assets from today\u2019s complex attacks.\nFireblocks utilizes the latest  security technologies \u2013 including MPC-CMP, Intel \nSGX, Workflow Authorization , and an institutional asset transfer network  \u2013 in a \nbattle-tested, layered implementation. This is our \u201cmulti-layer\u201d security philosophy: \nby utilizing multiple security controls that aren\u2019t reliant on each other, we ensure \nthat your entire business does not rely on one layer of security. \nThe Fireblocks platform is designed to provide the necessary speed, flexibility, and \ncost savings to meet business goals while ensuring that every cyberattack vector \nis completely mitigated. \n24\nFireblocks\u2019 Multi-layer Philosophy for Securing Digital Assets",
