MPC-\nCMP removes the concept of a single private key; such a key is never gathered \nas a whole, neither during the first creation of the wallet nor during the actual \nsignature . MPC-CMP follows a set of steps to guarantee that there is never a \nsingle point of compromise of the private key:\n1\n2\n3Individual secrets are randomized by each of the several (always more than 3) \nendpoints \u2013 either servers or mobile devices. Those secrets are never shared \nwith each other.\nThe individual endpoints engage in a decentralized wallet creation protocol in \nwhich they compute the public key (wallet address) that corresponds to the set \nof individual private shares.\nWhen a signature on a blockchain transaction is requested, a quorum (at least \n3) of endpoints engage in a distributed signature process where each one of \nthe endpoints individually validates the transaction and policy and signs the \ntransaction.\nPushing MPC Wallet \nSigning Speeds 8X \nwith MPC-CMP\n16\nFireblocks\u2019 Multi-layer Philosophy for Securing Digital Assets",
