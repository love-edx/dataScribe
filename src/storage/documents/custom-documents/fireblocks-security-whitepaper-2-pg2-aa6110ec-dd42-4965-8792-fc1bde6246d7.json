In fact, hackers have stolen over \n$15 billion total in crypto in the past 8 years .\nWith 20+ years of industry experience among each of our leaders \nand an academic cryptography advisement team, we understand \nthat no security technology alone is unbreakable. As we\u2019ve seen \nover the years, the best defense against cybercriminals is a \nmultilayered one that can provide redundancy in the event that one \nof the security controls fails.\nThat\u2019s why, at Fireblocks, we\u2019ve designed a security system that \nlayers the strongest software and hardware defenses to make \nbreaking in highly expensive and nearly impossible \u2013 creating \na truly secure environment for storing, transferring, and issuing \ndigital assets. \nAt the same time, Fireblocks is designed to support the operational \nneeds of a digital asset business. We mitigate the top threats to \ndigital assets, while delivering the necessary speed, flexibility, and \ntools to meet your business objectives. \nIn this white paper, we\u2019ll walk you through \neverything you need to know about protecting \ndigital assets.Fireblocks\u2019 Multi-layer \nPhilosophy for Securing \nDigital Assets\nMulti-layer security is an \napproach to cybersecurity \nin which multiple defensive \nmechanisms are deployed in \ntandem to protect data and \ninformation. A methodology \nof this sort \u2014 in which one \nlayer of security being \ncompromised doesn\u2019t break \nthe entire system \u2014 is able \nto address a variety of attack \nvectors at once and decrease \nthe likelihood of a successful \nbreach. \nIn cybersecurity, experts \noften refer to this type \nof security as the \u201ccastle \napproach\u201d due to its \nstructural similarity to a \nmedieval castle. To penetrate \na castle, attackers must get \nthrough several layers of \nsecurity, namely the moat, \nramparts, drawbridge, \ntowers, battlements, etc.WHAT IS MULTI-\nLAYER SECURITY?\n3\nFireblocks\u2019 Multi-layer Philosophy for Securing Digital Assets",
